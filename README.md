## Magefine's Magento Setup Script ðŸš€

Hey there, Magento devs! This script is here to make your life a little easier. Whether youâ€™re setting up a brand-new Magento project or trying to wrestle with an existing one, weâ€™ve got you covered.

### What Does It Do? ðŸŒŸ

1. **Handles Your `.env` for You**
    - Donâ€™t have a `.env` file? Itâ€™ll create one.
    - Missing variables? Itâ€™ll ask for them (with smart defaults).

2. **Works with Existing Projects**
    - Automatically grabs files like `magefine-compose.yml`.
    - Builds and starts your Docker containers.

3. **Sets Up Fresh Projects**
    - Fixes those pesky permissions automatically.

4. **Deals with Databases**
    - Option to initialize a new database or restore from a dump.

5. **Keeps Things on Track**
    - Checks for Docker and cURL so nothing breaks halfway through.
